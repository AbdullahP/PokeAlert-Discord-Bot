# Anti-Detection and Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the anti-detection and performance optimizations implemented in the monitoring engine to ensure reliable and efficient product monitoring while avoiding detection by anti-bot measures.

## Overview

The Pokemon Discord Bot implements comprehensive anti-detection measures and performance optimizations to ensure reliable monitoring of product availability while avoiding detection by anti-bot systems. These measures are critical for maintaining the bot's ability to provide near real-time stock notifications without being blocked by target websites.

## Key Features

### 1. User Agent Rotation and Browser Fingerprinting

- **Advanced User Agent Rotation**: Implements a comprehensive list of modern browser user agents across different platforms (Windows, macOS, mobile devices) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Browser-Specific Headers**: Adds realistic browser-specific headers based on the user agent, including security headers like `sec-ch-ua` and `sec-fetch-*` headers.
- **Randomized Header Values**: Randomly omits certain headers (like DNT and Referer) to create more natural-looking requests.
- **Referer Rotation**: Uses a variety of common referrers to make requests appear to come from different sources.

### 2. Rate Limiting and Request Timing

- **Token Bucket Rate Limiter**: Implements a token bucket algorithm to control request rates and prevent triggering rate limits.
- **Configurable Rate Limits**: Allows configuration of requests per second, burst size, and window size.
- **Randomized Request Delays**: Adds random delays between requests to mimic human browsing patterns.

### 3. Retry Mechanisms with Exponential Backoff

- **Exponential Backoff**: Implements increasing delays between retry attempts to handle temporary failures gracefully.
- **Jitter**: Adds randomness to retry delays to prevent thundering herd problems when recovering from failures.
- **Error-Specific Handling**: Uses different backoff strategies for different types of errors (rate limiting, server errors, potential bot detection).

### 4. Connection Pooling and Performance Optimizations

- **Advanced Connection Pooling**: Configures aiohttp connection pooling for optimal performance.
- **Connection Reuse**: Maintains persistent connections with keepalive to reduce connection establishment overhead.
- **DNS Caching**: Implements DNS caching to reduce DNS lookup latency for repeated requests.
- **Host-Specific Connection Limits**: Prevents overwhelming a single host with too many concurrent connections.
- **Optimized TCP Connector**: Uses custom TCP connector settings for better performance and reliability.
- **Async DNS Resolution**: Implements asynchronous DNS resolution for improved performance.

### 5. Cache Busting

- **URL Cache Busting**: Adds timestamp parameters to URLs to prevent caching of responses.
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled or disabled based on the target website's behavior.

## Configuration Options

The monitoring engine supports the following configuration options:

```python
{
    'retry': {
        'max_retries': 3,          # Maximum number of retry attempts
        'base_delay': 1.0,         # Initial delay in seconds
        'max_delay': 30.0,         # Maximum delay in seconds
        'exponential_base': 2.0,   # Base for exponential backoff
        'jitter': True             # Add randomness to delays
    },
    'rate_limit': {
        'requests_per_second': 2.0, # Maximum requests per second
        'burst_size': 5,           # Number of requests allowed in a burst
        'window_size': 60          # Window size in seconds for rate limiting
    },
    'anti_detection': {
        'min_delay': 0.5,          # Minimum delay between requests
        'max_delay': 2.0,          # Maximum delay between requests
        'use_cache_busting': True  # Enable cache busting
    },
    'connection_pool': {
        'limit': 20,               # Total connection limit
        'limit_per_host': 5,       # Connection limit per host
        'dns_cache_ttl': 300,      # DNS cache TTL in seconds
        'keepalive_timeout': 30    # Keepalive timeout in seconds
    }
}
```

## Usage Example

```python
# Configure the monitoring engine with anti-detection settings
config_manager = ConfigManager()
monitoring_engine = MonitoringEngine(config_manager)

# Monitor a product with anti-detection measures
product_data = await monitoring_engine.monitor_product(product_url)
```

## Testing

The anti-detection and performance optimizations are tested in `tests/services/test_anti_detection.py`, which includes tests for:

- Exponential backoff behavior
- Rate limiting functionality
- User agent rotation and header generation
- Connection pooling configuration
- Retry logic with different error scenarios

## Performance Impact

These optimizations provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Reliability**: Better handling of transient errors and rate limits
2. **Reduced Detection Risk**: More human-like request patterns to avoid bot detection
3. **Better Resource Utilization**: Efficient connection pooling and reuse
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Proper handling of error conditions without crashing

The optimizations are designed to balance performance with stealth, ensuring that the monitoring engine can operate efficiently while minimizing the risk of detection.
