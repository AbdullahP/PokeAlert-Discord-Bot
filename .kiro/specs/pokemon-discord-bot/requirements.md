# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a high-performance Discord bot that monitors bol.com for Pokemon product availability in near real-time. The bot will provide the fastest possible stock notifications to Discord servers, with a modular architecture that supports future expansion to additional websites. The system prioritizes speed, reliability, and stealth to deliver instant notifications while avoiding detection by anti-bot measures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord server admin, I want to add Pokemon product URLs and wishlist links to monitor, so that my community receives instant notifications when products come in stock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin provides a bol.com product URL THEN the system SHALL validate and add it to the monitoring list
2. WHEN an admin provides a bol.com wishlist URL THEN the system SHALL extract all Pokemon products and add them to monitoring
3. WHEN adding a product THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to specific Discord channels
4. IF a product URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL return an error message with details
5. WHEN a product is successfully added THEN the system SHALL confirm addition and display monitoring status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord server admin, I want to manage monitoring settings and channel assignments, so that notifications are properly routed and controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin wants to modify a monitored product THEN the system SHALL allow editing of channel assignments and monitoring intervals
2. WHEN an admin wants to remove a product THEN the system SHALL stop monitoring and remove it from the database
3. WHEN an admin assigns a product to a channel THEN the system SHALL validate channel permissions and accessibility
4. WHEN monitoring settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without restart
5. IF channel assignments conflict THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate assignments and show error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord server member, I want to receive instant notifications when monitored Pokemon products are in stock, so that I have the best chance to purchase them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monitored product changes from out-of-stock to in-stock THEN the system SHALL send a Discord notification within 10 seconds
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include product name, price, stock status, and direct purchase link
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL use rich embeds with product images when available
4. WHEN a product comes in stock THEN the system SHALL mention configured roles for urgent alerts
5. WHEN multiple products change status simultaneously THEN the system SHALL send individual notifications for each

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the monitoring engine to operate continuously with high performance, so that no stock changes are missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL check each product at configurable intervals (minimum 30 seconds)
2. WHEN making requests to bol.com THEN the system SHALL implement anti-detection measures including user-agent rotation and request delays
3. WHEN bol.com blocks requests THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN monitoring multiple products THEN the system SHALL distribute requests to avoid rate limiting
5. IF monitoring fails for a product THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue monitoring other products

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Discord server admin, I want to view monitoring status and performance metrics, so that I can ensure the system is working effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin requests status THEN the system SHALL display all monitored products with their current status
2. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL show success rates, response times, and error counts
3. WHEN monitoring encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert admins through Discord notifications
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring history for the past 24 hours

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the bot to have a modular design, so that additional website scrapers can be easily added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the monitoring engine THEN the system SHALL use a plugin-based architecture for website scrapers
2. WHEN adding new scrapers THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to core functionality
3. WHEN implementing scrapers THEN the system SHALL use standardized interfaces for product data
4. WHEN scrapers fail THEN the system SHALL isolate failures to prevent affecting other scrapers
5. WHEN new websites are added THEN the system SHALL support different monitoring strategies per website

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Discord server admin, I want to control bot access and permissions, so that only authorized users can manage monitoring settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users attempt admin commands THEN the system SHALL verify Discord permissions before execution
2. WHEN setting up the bot THEN the system SHALL require specific Discord roles for admin access
3. WHEN unauthorized users try admin functions THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
4. WHEN admin permissions change THEN the system SHALL update access controls immediately
5. IF permission verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required permissions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery, so that the bot maintains high uptime and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry requests with exponential backoff up to 3 times
2. WHEN Discord API errors occur THEN the system SHALL queue notifications and retry delivery
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and attempt recovery procedures
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and attempt graceful degradation
5. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation without manual intervention

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Discord server admin, I want to configure notification preferences, so that alerts match my community's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring notifications THEN the system SHALL allow customization of embed colors and formatting
2. WHEN setting up alerts THEN the system SHALL support role mentions for different product categories
3. WHEN products have price changes THEN the system SHALL optionally include price tracking in notifications
4. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL respect Discord rate limits to avoid being blocked
5. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry and log delivery status

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to store monitoring data and history, so that performance can be tracked and optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN products are monitored THEN the system SHALL store check timestamps, response times, and status changes
2. WHEN stock changes occur THEN the system SHALL record the change with timestamp and previous status
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies to manage storage size
4. WHEN queried THEN the system SHALL provide historical data for performance analysis
5. WHEN data storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring while logging storage errors
